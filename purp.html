        <h1>A Petition to Not Require Jeepney Drivers <br>
        in Buying or Paying for the said Modernized Jeepney</h1> <br>
        <h2>Purpose</h2> <br>
        <h3>What is the purpose of this petition?</h3> <br>
        
        <div style="background-color:#dfa247;" class="divv">
            <p>We fight for the drivers and operators of jeepneys that will only become more impoverished if the government's public utility vehicle modernization program—which calls for replacing outdated vehicles—is implemented. We fight for the removal of the modernization program, or atleast a reform that that places the needs of operators and commuters first and understands the cultural relevancy of the jeepney. Jeepneys are an integral symbol of Filipino culture, an attack on the jeepney is an attack on the collective consiousness of the Filipino people and an attack on the lower classes that benefit from the jeepney system for their livelihood and day-to-day life.</p>
