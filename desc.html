        <h1>A Petition to Not Require Jeepney Drivers <br>
        in Buying or Paying for the said Modernized Jeepney</h1> <br>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>What is this petition all about?</h3> <br>
        
        <div style="background-color:#dfa247;" class="divv">
            <p>The Jeepney Phase Out Opposition emphasizes potential negative effects on drivers' 
                livelihoods and dissuades them from purchasing new, upgraded jeepneys. Proponents 
                contend that traditional jeepney drivers' livelihoods are seriously threatened by the 
                cost of purchasing these modernized vehicles and resulting regulatory adjustments. 
                Also, drivers may find it difficult to pay for the switch to more contemporary vehicles, 
                so worries regarding accessibility and affordability for them highlight the need to 
                reconsider the suggested phase-out rules. The opposition argues that in order to lessen 
                the financial burden on jeepney operators and maintain the cultural and economic 
                significance of these iconic vehicles, other options should be investigated, such as 
                updating current vehicles with eco-friendly technology or providing financial assistance 
                programs.</p>

            <p>Jeepney operators and drivers will only fall into deeper poverty should the governmentâ€™s public utility vehicle modernization program, which includes phasing out old units, push through.
                Transport groups Stop and Go Coalition and Piston (Pinagkaisang Samahan ng Tsuper at 
                Opereytor Nationwide) stressed this point, saying they support rehabilitation of the public 
                utility vehicle sector but oppose a phaseout of the venerable jeepney, an icon of the post-war 
                era. jeepney phaseout may have leave to some bad effects to jeepney drivers thatbcan cause to 
                them a huge problem.</p>
