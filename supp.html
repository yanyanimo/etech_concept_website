        <h1>A Petition to Not Require Jeepney Drivers <br>
        in Buying or Paying for the said Modernized Jeepney</h1> <br>
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <h3>How can we spread this petition around the country?</h3> <br>
        
        <div style="background-color:#dfa247;" class="divv">
            <p>Since 1998, one of our clasmate's father has worked as a jeepney driver, providing unwavering
                 support for their family. He has assisted them in various aspects, enabling her
                  siblings to receive education in private schools. One of them has successfully
                   become a civil engineer. <i>Recently, when her father heard a news that our
                    traditional jeepney would be replaced with a modern or electric version, he faced
                     a financial challenge due to his modest income.</i> This is why <u>we're advocating 
                     against imposing the obligation for jeepney drivers to purchase modernized 
                     jeeps.</u> <i>Mandating drivers to purchase new vehicles could lead to significant 
                     debt accumulation for them. Given that many jeepney drivers operate on limited 
                     incomes, requiring them to bear the full cost of modernization might worsen their 
                     financial strain, impacting their livelihoods negatively.</i> To ensure a smoother 
                     transition, alternative approaches, such as government subsidies, financial 
                     assistance programs, or phased implementation, could be explored to alleviate 
                     the economic burden on drivers during the modernization process.</p>

                 worries, setting up physical petition signing stations in community hubs, and
